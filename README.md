# PompousTrash
Top-down 2D game made for a game jam about a celebrity  
Code and animation made by me, art made by my sister  
Downloadable on Windows here: https://j02.itch.io/pompoustrash

Overall Positives:
* Decent idea that fits the game jam theme -> Could be developed further for a different game
* The signature mission is creative
  
Negatives:
* Needs a tutorial
* Requires a better objective of the game rather than simply trying to stay alive
